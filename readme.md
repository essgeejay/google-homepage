Foundation Project : Recreating the Google Hompage. 

From The Odin Project's curriculum: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

My thoughts going in were a little daunting at first (esspecially starting from a completly blank html document) but once i started doing research on html elments and css properties - i think i understood what was going on.

I did somewhat get carried away with the little details but thats proabably due to my creative background.
